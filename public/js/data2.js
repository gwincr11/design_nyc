A secondary goal of the project is to provide the Alliance with some updated and new icons that can be put into use in their promotional communications for the various events held throughout the year. It is our collective hope that once our work is put to use, a greater awareness about the Bronx River Alliance’s mission will be understood. Through the use of a cohesive, consistent aesthetic approach, more people will be inspired to contribute toward this worthy endeavor. Eventually, additional revenue streams could be garnered through the sale of consumer-based artifacts that utilize the work that we created, such as t-shirts, mugs, tote bags, buttons, posters, and more.",
